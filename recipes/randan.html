	<h3>Scotch can be used in a cocktail.  Really.</h3>
	<p>Purists loudly insist that scotch must be served neat and no other way. The uninitiated believe that, thus there are few scotch cocktails out there compared to gin, rum, et cetera.  While I enjoy a good sipping scotch, there is no reason why scotch cannot be used like any other liquor.  One just has to follow the same rule that one follows with all liquor: There are no rules.  Drink what you want.</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1.50 oz Blended Scotch</li>
		<li>0.75 oz Espresso Liquer</li>
		<li>0.25 oz Cinnamon Syrup</li>
		<li>1 Dash Orange Bitters</li>		
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Chill a cocktail glass in the freezer</li>
		<li>Add the first three ingredients to a mixing glass</li>
		<li>Stir for 30 seconds</li>		
		<li>Strain into the pre-chilled cocktail glass</li>
		<li>Dash bitters on top and serve</li>
	</ol>
